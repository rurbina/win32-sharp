win32-sharp is a wrapper library over a large portion of native win32 functions.  It is designed to allow easy inclusion into a project without needing to redeclare many p-invokes.

This project started as a side project and at this point is in now way comprehensive.  That said, many of the apis are included, with particular emphasis on user32 window management functions.

Please feel free to contribute to this project.  Any patches that add new APIs and fit into the existing coding style will be gladly accepted, hopefully allowing this project to be a comprehensive wrapper over the win32 API.
